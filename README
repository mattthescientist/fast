The FTS Atomic Spectrum Tool (FAST) - version 0.6
Source code archive
================================================================================

The FTS Atomic Spectrum Tool (FAST) is an interactive graphical program designed
to work in conjunction with the XGremlin package to simplify the analysis of
atomic line spectra obtained from Fourier transform spectrometers. Calculated
line parameters (e.g. from the Kurucz database) are loaded alongside their
observed line profiles for easy comparison between theory and experiment. Many
such profiles, which could span numerous spectra, may be viewed simultaneously
to help the user detect problems from line blending or self-absorption. Once the
user has determined that the XGremlin line profile fits are good, a key feature
of FAST is the ability to determine atomic branching fractions, transition
probabilities, and oscillator strengths, which is not provided by existing
analysis packages.

For instrunctions on compiling and installing FAST, please see the FAST manual, 
which is included in this archive (docs/fast.pdf).
